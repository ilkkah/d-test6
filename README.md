`Model.sort()/.filter()` needs some improvement I think?

In this app, when you change the rooms, you can first see messages from both rooms (previous and current room). There is some delay until the filter has effect, I guess.

`lobby` contains messages with blue icon, `lobby2` contains messages with green icon. Seeing both at the same time here (not good).
